    /**
     * My Plan
     * Main class is App
     * Test class is AppTest - goal was to TDD but lost in some rusty coding skills:)
     *
     * create classes to map out Jobs, Characteristics, and Individuals
     * create a Job class - Job Id, Characteristic, matched value = 100
     * create a class for Job Characteristics - characteristic, keywords (for matching against individual skills), matchScore = 20(?)
     * Create a class for Individual - Id, characteristics, score
     * Characteristics will contain a list of keywords for matching
     * Build a list of Jobs with Characteristics
     * Create an Individual with a list of keywords for skills
     * run Individual through matcher to match against Job Characteristics to get match score
     * Cycle Individual skills/characteristics against Job characteristic keywords
     * Matcher could match using RegEx, but probably a framework or library that would do this better. To investigate
     * Compare Individual score against Jobs to see which matched best
     * Return the winning Job
